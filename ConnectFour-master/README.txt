Our board is comprised of 0’s, 1’s for the player, 2’s for the bot’s move. 1’s and 2’s are added as the game progresses.2) A method to drop pieces, if able3) A method to evaluate goal states4) A stochastic bot that randomly chooses columns to drop pieces in5) A class for minimax that has a minimum successor evaluator and a maximum successor evaluator6) A class for minimax using a heuristic to stop the algorithm at a certain depth which is also the difficulty7) A class to implement the heuristic. The heuristic evaluates player position and bot position and assigns a utility between 1 and -18) Alpha beta pruning is added to minimax in a separate class using a new double and if clause in each minimax evaluator. How to run connect 4: 	Compile and run the program. Input required when prompted to place pieces in columns
